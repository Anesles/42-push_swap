# **push_swap (Cursus from 42 Porto)**
## **Grade: WIP**
---
### **Summary:**

In this project I had to develop a program that creates 2 stacks (_a_ with _integers_ and _b_ with nothing inside), organizes stack _a_ integers in ascending order and prints the operations it used.

#### **Installing and running the project:**
* Clone this repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:Anesles/42-push_swap.git
```
* Run `make`.
```
make
```
* Run the program with as many integers you desire.
```
./push_swap 3 7 1 5 2
```
---
### **Makefile targets**
* `make` or `make all` - Compiles the program.
* `make clean` - Cleans all object files.
* `make fclean` - Cleans all object files, _client_ and _server_.
* `make re` - Cleans everything (fclean) and recompiles.
